// This code will validate the user's input, showing
// precisely which fields have not yet been filled out.
// When a field has not yet been touched, it will not
// show an error. When a field has not properly been
// filled out but the user has typed in it (even if it's empty),
// it will show an error. The user will not be able to
// submit until the frontend validation says it's okay.
// Each field is also checked more rigorously on the backend
