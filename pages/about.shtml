        The remainder will go to whichever party received more donations. This 
        ensures that donating through DuelGood has the same political impact 
        as donating directly to a political party, in addition to saving lives.

        Each day at 7:00 PM EST, the day's donations are compared and 
        sent. Up until that time you can cancel or edit your donation. 
        Transactions are processed through the most secure and proven 
        payment processors in the industry, so your financial details
