        When you donate to a net-zero cause through DuelGood, 
        your donation is matched with an equal opposing donation 
        and both go to life-saving charities.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, if Alice donates $10 to the pro-life 
        Cause A and Bob donates $8 to the pro-choice Cause B, 
        then $8 + $8 = $16 goes to charity and the remaining $2 goes to Cause A.

        The remainder will go to whichever cause received more donations. This 
        ensures that donating through DuelGood has the same political impact 
        as donating directly to a political party, in addition to saving lives.
